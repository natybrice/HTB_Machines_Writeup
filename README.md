# HTB Machines Writeups

Welcome to my **HTB Machines Writeups** repository!  

This repository contains detailed writeups of **Hack The Box (HTB)** machines that I solve. Each writeup will document the full process of enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation for a given machine.  

## Purpose

- To track my HTB progress and learning.
- To share insights and methodologies with others interested in penetration testing.
- To serve as a reference for practicing ethical hacking techniques.

## Structure

Each machine will have its own folder:
